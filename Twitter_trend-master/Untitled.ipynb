get game jeff right right yeah i worked real estate auction company i business development basically job wine dine bank executives get give us call special assets sports complexes funeral homes restaurants things fit traditional mold mls could put we would come advertise auction hopefully sell sometimes sell properties higher prices recession i laid we first ones we company cars expense accounts phones i everything first ones crash hit people get selling bank foreclosures bank foreclosures time know special asset properties selling less everyone put brakes kind waiting recovery again first ones so i started buying mls properties case dry look sources realized business model could sustain income predictable monthly basis so end business i fall auction job jeff i right college i started selling cars right it tough grind learn sales need yeah jeff and i rewind little bit saw advertisement paper someone looking someone help real estate business lease options long story short sales aspect so people would call would send give script cds read listen sending ton deals i experience come able pay i basically applied also owned auto auction i applied job real estate experience it always passion mine kind fell job auction company enjoyed passion right so laid mind end taking first leaps deals jeff right like lot people i started studying everything i could i always interest i think like people i i knew everything i could talk party i real estate fever know party like oh jeff he talk real estate know people would oh great how many houses i like none i know but i research bought lot programs point money getting tight i found program wholesaling hud houses borrow money girlfriend time wife buy program so i burned bridge i make work oh another program need involving costing money studied learned everything i could i started buying wholesaling hud properties buying mls started good you know first i made every mistake book know kind trusted process joke best buyers i contract days til contract expired i put craigslist he came looked like alright i like know read guys oh people close two three days cash buyers i like great close days like title work i kind fumbled oh hud deal we never issues past like i understand done title work i like yeah done know kind things learn courses they tell i get deal market sell make cash forever rich kind second layer know title work inspections call dye tests it plumbing make sure gutters sewers little things i clue you know never took first step never first deal never fumble figure stuff kind side shiny object know figure fumble now best buyers he buys properties year everyone biggest fear i look stupid what i wrong fear i sure point kill relationship best buyers so i started yeah ton stuff i dissect jeff yeah let talk first bought course kind jeff right and i like know like talk courses gurus things like quite often biggerpockets generally like tell people need necessarily that i sure good information i like courses tell little bit tell everything right jeff right the courses give enough get started good information it kind gets hump mechanics whole second layer another aspect get property you know sell how next steps get title get permits that i know course tell every area different i guess tell i think lot courses lacking get put try find cash buyer close make big checks you know glossed there behind scenes almost know started might prevent people stuff needs figured done i next step yeah i kind whole courses sold end like hey take course rich tools need you tools need still fumbling making mistakes trying figure like problem this biggerpockets born i issue personally jeff right so bp created so gotten taken courses kind fumbled figuring stuff survived right you first deal can remember looked like can tell us jeff yeah i it property it blue collar part town still good school district i knew know part town i could sell a good rental area contract the real estate agent friend mine still joke called accepted i guess getting real know ta figure next so i put craigslist went real estate club meetings trying know people deal kind aw shoot deal start second guess put payment time i pretty broke so i borrow money course i also borrow money payment permits everything so know i think helped looking back retrospect i make work another oh know i involving people trials tribulations just know figure make work like put days contract expired i find buyer hud deals pay money extend contracts another days able able get closed i think i made proof concept yeah jeff you know solve problems i rich immediately proved worked it proved people leant money worked another aspect mls deals hud houses come funding whether transactional funding borrowing that another courses tell they transactional funding title company saying great come i like i know know they also mark make with mls hud properties back back close so i pay full transfer tax front end exempt exemption nobody pays exemption means pay pay side then title i pay sell so price i think i walked away end day huge learning lesson i think taught side get deal need move place close yeah so i want back touch things people listening might completely lost like wait wholesaling what hud house what jeff sure so take beginning first talking wholesaling jeff means i put property contract within days whatever timeframe i agreed bank agreed i try find another buyer buy property higher price i that first deal i contract hud i put contract end buyer i thought would easy i get make spread yeah jeff and difference bank owned properties hud houses bank owned properties mls direct seller marketing two different avenues two different ways close deals especially wholesaler you assign deal means i would assign rights interest another buyer fee would difference i neighbor next door buying house i assign rights take difference walk away step might getting ahead sure yeah gets little bit confusing i idea assignment versus back back closing you know lot articles biggerpockets in show notes show i put link articles people want dive i link good articles exactly means so saying back back close hud home home purchased housing housing urban development like right jeff correct yeah bought repo so buy house immediately resell i within day right jeff within minutes yes so property short time pay transfer tax county city whatever tax pay twice bought sold jeff correct so make made around extra charges jeff right exactly makes sense jeff and know tested figured i clue exempt closing cost could you know sister friend works large we buy houses companies i sure everyone city they billboards everything awesome i helpful i someone i could ask always lot questions people biggerpockets find mentor and started lunch everyone yeah jeff and i tell people anyone business right lunch sell know i i always tell people find property get first hud house get first contract take somebody business hey i willing cut deal help what i need next yep jeff a lot people like put cart horse want find mentor first want find deal gives warm fuzzy feeling i think matter get get deal get contract know sister friend big flipping business ultimately i competition so necessarily know good helped i pay i would willing you know experience worth making big first check get get deal try find someone i get lot people i posted biggerpockets hud houses answered lot questions people come i money marketing i experience could i wholesale hud houses and i try point direction biggerpockets podcast ones learn get anyone else savior it taking action getting talking people making offers getting then get make mistakes like i look stupid front people know oh never problem title yeah sure know he knew i know know it still joke today make turned biggest buyer that a lot people lot competition area i found competition buyers sellers so instead looking competition i know i get started get know how get meet meetings hey need someone take pictures property put lockbox i know not hey i buy panera lunch give info yeah i love yep i love jeff i love part talk competition allies we always lot new investors fearful know afraid not new investors old investors around block long time like oh i start helping people hurt get deals nonsense you know always limit there always cap much much business company frankly like folks market buyers they folks deals business yeah absolutely makes sense get get know competition competition partners yep jeff exactly that i found know i guys signs ones business know so want four years ago could talk talk never bought property could day lot i i bashing ta get guys deals offer bring if somebody comes deal says hey i pay half fee help walk title heck yeah know i day yeah makes much sense i lunch people occasionally talk great i like eating lunch i like getting free dinner somebody comes i couple weeks ago a friend mine wants get real estate came hey i deal want partner if i get would partner exchange showing done course i i would happy i work like physical work brought deal it shows enthusiastic shows takes succeed yeah i think fantastic people bring deal want get mentor money experience how find deal so shift focus talk little bit kind i let give broader view today jeff sure in terms main focus how many what kind stuff working today jeff right yeah i business wholesaling i start rehabs last year half coming wholesaling perspective lot work know i enjoy people ask wholesaling rehab but back another question someone getting wholesaling would rehabbers buy property what point why buy why getting good deal the real answer guys rehabbing properties hours day they spending hours putting hud bids taking postcard letters sending postcards get phone calls get meetings deals know that question i everyone says tell people oh yeah i find property mls sell someone a experienced b money would you know but guys rely good wholesalers you also get question good deal selling why keeping i like cause i wholesaler i contractors i private money i everything back end lined i dig deals i bring guys like that valid question lot people would buy what bring times starting sell guys experienced money no i saying pretend donald trump game forever learn lingo biggerpockets books places try fumble first deal two so right wholesale know anywhere deals

contract month em sold i like hey great look know life set i sitting beach i figured mercy like make bids there lot less bank owned properties transition try find dig deals base business bank owned properties tough predictable direct mail predictable you numbers testing shown i send x amount postcards i think i mentioned briefly i get calls meetings deals so find different get predictable business find direct mail us alright so let back talk basics for know direct mail marketing what jeff sure direct mail marketing basically sending home owner postcard says hey we buy houses area would interested selling house cash condition what basically send lot people biggerpockets podcast absentee owners we like state absentee owners especially area my sister brother law properties moved relocated north carolina i hey guys getting postcards anyone properties saying buy i kind knew lag area so focus lot state absentee owners someone owns property like sister live state transferred state still rentals area name show tax record owner look tax record property owner address property know either absentee state mail guys what approach is hey tired owning property i know kind hit jeff yeah difference make difference direct mail everyone goes back forth get big vanity number do play small i done i found i sure people debate biggerpockets day small worked better just saying hey buy properties area rental portfolio if interested selling cash day choice give us call know and everyone direct mail matter make people angry it name game i know just let roll back yeah jeff anyone sent amount direct mail made somebody angry trying sell book guru cause people gon na get mad whatever reason they get angry know name address know property you know people aware public records get defensive part if easy everyone would it digging getting leads getting end buyer keep so postcard letter or jeff i times i think someone talked briefly recent shows send postcard first cause lot cheaper yellow letters expensive the envelopes stamps whole process get lot back bad addresses whole subject gold mine ones come back lot people stop dig try find owners send first inexpensive the difference could anywhere cents postcard yellow letter jeff which know letters work depends mass approach smaller targeted approach would use letter send general absentee use postcard try weed know hey jeff opened door man i ta bad addresses what bad addresses jeff know subscribe couple different sites kind skip trace people try find addresses phone numbers guys make know business trying call people costs dollars per name could worth deal so bad addresses come back work set side try find basic research white pages see address updated county website move intelius programs tlo pretty expensive business model gold lot people throw away aw nobody forget too much work yeah jeff yeah those people nobody talking getting nobody else know what higher success rate bad addresses typical mail jeff know i think less competition know if get ahold talk many people if marketing hot areas town people i two guys coming fine stop change i may offer property lot times get talked kind surprised you know hey find kind awkward giving cold call sometimes hey property people may best friend hey wan na give great ever call ta willing roll dice know yep let back step i ask find list how get list people i talk public records how get jeff right lot list service providers us lead list affiliation pull pull anything absentee owners state absentee owners free clear properties could mortgage values foreclosure starting default also monthly subscriptions vacant properties things joined found pretty useful worked us usually anything cents per name continue hit list times you know find take wasting money like talked ones getting correct address continue hit list times times people keep postcards year two i get deal closed days postcard year half ago set side needed money ready sell called went saw two people postcards first you know bigger companies time get sometimes smaller know i next afternoon made deal she i tell guys come i closed days know we solved problem oh send competition c mon jeff yeah best referral sources i happy closed we paid ton money house fix fix never there lot people like think oh shows make look easy a half hour plus commercials time find another house flip realize easy like gon na fix realized much us know yeah you mentioned couple times i want kind dive i love funnels if listeners ever biggerpockets webinar i talk every webinar every week you sign next i love idea funnel get certain number reach certain number people certain percentage call certain percentage show property like invite look whatever certain percentage accept offer so kind talk funnel percentage wise ratios is average typically see is always different or averages look like jeff know found averages testing sending we find send postcards get somewhere nature calls that sound like great numbers right bat that days postcard hits still people set aside it important keep phone numbers if i could back quickly use called vumber it virtual phone number our calls hour recorded message postcards hour recorded message it little less threatening people call hear message rather think i talk shifty talk selling house nothing quickly little bit less aggressive send hour recorded message then hodio set i know people mentioned data base system put vumber awesome it come phone computer email new phone call new voicemail team members send back forth that starts find high percentage get calls ones call listen voicemail leave message lot motivated we call the deal i mentioned houses i wholesaled rehabbed hang they oh want call talking hey saw called i thought gon na issue what house people section people wanted get rid you call back if spending money buy name send list system ta work afraid first answer phone call that true i love persistent you follow bad addresses calling hang ups i i think kind separating wheat chaff right that successful versus unsuccessful that newbie saying oh work i spent money i nothing did everything possibly could list awesome jeff right i think that difference low hanging fruit guys coming i solve problem found somebody else start real estate business books gurus make sound like making tens thousands immediately opened hair salon bowling alley whatever expect make money two years if somebody starts puts money make months oh work my area work give hair salon bowling alley months you would expect make money i love man jeff it gon na take work time see passionate i i shut i talk lot i enjoy i like part hey jeff calls every how many calls end appointments how many appointments end actual sales can kind walk us rest jeff yeah try couple different ways we found ask hey lowest best cash price little different sometimes see house talk meet could sometimes waste time i ones tells wants i think tough take less i gone stuck i ones i gone looked house work neighbor like oh oh buys houses like come look house i selling mine i deal neighbor the lady realistic bought neighbor house less identical never know unless i found deals newspaper it older couple use craigslist i found since no i still look every week absolutely because i made wholesale deal newspaper that i tell guys i make money drive around look vacant

neighbors yeah i i ask neighbors hey house want vacant much i want buy that good point jeff so help find they know they might oh i know anything lighten find know everything they know foreclosed divorce case keep eye once looking properties find so fears lot direct mail marketing i systems yet set able phone calls i phone calls appointments so many think let phone calls month many would house make offer think jeff i i called listened voicemail left message know i then look might find looking buyer might find realistic might realistic that another always send offer mail people call us back hey offer still good will still take difference started last year sending offer mail crazy don call six months road need money situation changed hate bad willing take ask price offer least talk yeah so saying make offer person later send letter matter correct if turn jeff right i love i think fantastic oh man that good again follows everything else talked you extra things yeah extra mile jeff

i might never walk i memory i literally could come hang three hours gone bathroom come back hospital i would memory three hours it bad good i would messed whole time hal yeah funny part i brain damage i suffered frontal lobe right collision brain controls judgment inhibitions short term memory so ironically i hit drunk driver damage caused like i drunk time so brain damage i anything young man thought i hot nurse nurse wendy used bathe like sponge bath years old hot nurse bathing like thinking i i like hey nurse wendy fair i get bathe so point friends used come like friday night like what tonight like dude let visit hal ask crazy stuff see and yeah funny that great thank goodness survived obviously led transformation mind led book so let kind accident book write book kind hal yeah miracle morning second book books written exact reason i wanted author write book it i literally felt sense responsibility so first book taking life wo much detail premise right like wow i overcame in fact friend mine john told he goes hal take granted went experience think but goes dude died told never walk ran ultra marathon he goes if i i feel like number focus committing share book so first book and second book similar us economy crashed anybody anything real estate aware adversity created but i bought house peak market first house i short sold right half price and time economy crashed i deeply depressed crashed i six figure business i coach i speaker i author like living dream i bought house bought car everything great the economy crashes i lose everything inspired second book six months like real downward spiral depression feeling hopeless like everything i tried working i reading books i different things nothing turned around and keep long story short friend told write first book i called i dude i tough time i told anybody i success so kind counterintuitive tell people hey i failing miserably know anyone needs good success coach i kept secret i finally told and if i hal i would every morning run listen business book home goes the point run put peak physical mental emotional state educate need improve for business financing right peak state run straight home spend hour implementing whatever and i went i hate running first i and goes hate worse running life described and i like yeah screw i and i went run next morning i heard quote kind wrap story jim rohn quote turned entire life around responsible the miracle morning i everything faster i ever thought possible and jim rohn your level success seldom exceed level personal and moment i realized i dedicating time every day personal development i becoming person i need create success i want life i ran home epiphany i need create morning ritual that like world successful people morning ritual but question i make effective morning ritual known man i spent like hour researching ended known the miracle morning never book two months morning ritual i doubled income i went worst shape life physically running ultra marathon i went deeply depressed happiest i ever confident i ever and life changed fast i started calling the miracle morning and sharing clients seeing impact life light bulb went i again i responsibility i write book share world rest kind history wow i love that awesome yeah ahead i ask lot things mentioned like business making good money success coach do mind explaining little bit like depressed i obviously economy tanking whatever seems like would like you everything right how work hal i went successful i clarify yeah i think i clarify within short period time i lost half coaching clients therefore half income yeah happened i lost half clients i bad coach least i think it economy affected like hey either pay mortgage pay coach us i let coaching contract so i lost half income i could pay bills i pay mortgage i lost house right right yeah hal yeah i cancelled gym membership so economy crashed i body fat pounds tall like bad shape life right six months later i body fat six months so literal physically mentally emotionally financially i lowest point life and far depression goes almost perfect storm i talk part long time i almost i know embarrassed right word but economy crashed friend mine told i adhd i needed see doctor and i went saw doctor i adderall and back i think six i know different i thought i cool doctor i take and dad sent article day like dude adderall might bad so i quit cold turkey exact time economy started crash so i believe i physical withdrawals i aware mental withdrawals time so like perfect storm messed wow interesting yeah i taught special ed four years pretty much every kid i taught prescribed adderall whole cocktail stuff like come like hal it kills yeah hal yeah bad enough mid decide give shot try yeah hal but still developing developing beliefs limiting belief says i ca function society without medication yeah yeah let get the miracle morning rituals i know annoy living crap talking hey i and i like teacher trying prescribe crap end day i like i willpower i i envious ahead stuff though i give grief i want like i know like successful people create rituals live rituals continuously work improve it i dedicated starting year ago and i seen drastic change life outlook perspective business friend everything so exciting usually asking everybody oh i house i saying morning rituals tell hal yeah first i want point jealous attributes i know mentioned habits discipline beard like i wish i could grow beard i most people would like know there things crawling i jealous yeah lumber sexual beard right hal yeah i try grow long whiskers like spaced like three quarters inch around face that like ethan hawk style yeah hal yeah pretty bad anyway morning ritual happened i ran like i epiphany i heard jim rohn quote i ran home question world successful people personal development so actual morning ritual part first part it like jim rohn i believe saying level success seldom exceed level personal development the personal development vague topic right like vague term it like exactly so i went home i googling things like world successful people personal development right best personal development rituals successful people whatever i spent hour and happened i looking right i like alright i want find best practice personal development i every and i reading articles forbes fast company i ca narrow as i i like oh meditation world successful people swear meditation right i watched video ellen degeneres show i watching youtube will smith talking number key success and affirmations i like i right and i coming across jim carrey visualization right i see successful people talking journaling and i end list six practices i almost threw towel it call i and i trying figure better and epiphany like breakthrough i looking list i i wait minute i what i six powerful proven personal development practices known man and i like minutes course hour would like ultimate personal development and research i i see anyone like two three in fact i mentioned earlier robert kiyosaki wrote the miracle morning the miracle morning six practices he never heard anyone part daily ritual every day so next morning i woke i i morning person part like i find time people listening right hear people i ca fit meditation i ca fit six so i thought i wake hour earlier though morning person i try i give shot right another kept coming across successful people wake and let pause second think reason watching reason wake morning wake morning and two reasons either wanted right meaning us wake somewhere answer somebody else take kids school right literally think set alarm look schedule ask what last possible minute i could wake get divorced fired children taken away like definition mediocre morning us start day so side could think negative like energy alarm goes like oh i want wake like talking life gifting another day would jump bed and definitely mindset i decided wake next morning time i wake time i wanted wake and different energy alarm went felt kind like christmas morning i like this great i wake i try and i six practices i horrible right like i worst meditator ever i worst but literally morning entire life changed seven years ago never i went if i start every day like much clarity energy motivation matter time outer world reflects inner and i know would happen two months miracle the miracle morning title came i love and clearly working energy terrible i outlook pretty awful i yeah clearly yeah clearly let ask i guys like i ca get bed head always spinning i shut i get sleep and i getting better used two morning i still like i i kids family work everything yeah if i miracle morning i hal yeah starting cut beddy time make cranky hal yeah first i lunch wake lunch five lunch just kidding i kidding but deal i right everything know i so bed hour earlier normally would wake hour earlier and component book whole chapter i talk much sleep need i talk connection greatest minds history world like benjamin franklin thomas edison documented sleeping four five hours night so i like knows died years earlier i know would otherwise but beat died three times already good hal exactly big deal and i give i personally people kind found work so i bed i wake seven days week the time i wake morning i much energy wife i went john lee dumas book launch party last night we late i sleep three hours whatever idea need much sleep believe need think bed created belief says i need eight hours sleep belief came experience came popular perpetuated timeframe then bed get seven hours six hours tell feel morning six hours believe need eight yeah you like oh crap i get six hours hal yeah i exhausted six hours sleep prophesy alarm goes oh already whatever so point talk specifically getting matter shifting right matter making commitment and making change is value five i get done i start day i become i pm i want give example another i always would rather give someone else success story versus opinion i obviously biased i wrote book guys know pat flynn yes hal so pat flynn pat someone i i huge fan i sent copy the miracle morning long time ago never heard back and like six months later i email hal i keep hearing people i read book i he goes and sent i apologize i never he goes but look i morning person i night owl i living life dreams so i want show debate like convince i open i see so i business he wife dreams two amazing kids lives amazing lifestyle right i how hell i convince living dream change oh hardest part i wake i set alarm i wake kids run daddy daddy daddy and i how hell i top so keep long story short end interview i literally nervous ah ah i made case i explained the miracle morning and hal end goes i try he convinced happy productive i i might missing level fulfillment productivity could attained i wake earlier practices talking i willing try and like four days later i see miraclemorning posting pictures gym different stuff and long story short multiple episodes recapping the miracle morning changed life says productivity he minimum could quantify productivity increased four times so could pat flynn business robert kiyosaki worth million night owls i would tell take word worth trying days i tell talk much story like started reason i wanted show i loved book it changed i read year ago i i commit i days i commit and i sat days time i wanted things i want write book i i wanted write book rental properties investing so i sat i like i i committed six things i want talk savers get hal yeah savers yeah i i want i want make real estate business less stressful i i stressed point know depressed right like i overwhelmed everything in days i completely changed life i completely that i talk book time completely changed life not i write book i ended writing book wife i second book together another words like exactly days and like getting three morning whatever getting five time five hal sure but yeah totally changed life i officially thank hal writing book hal you welcome it totally changed things so yeah i i testify changed real estate business changed business life changed everything continues and i perfect i get every single day early but time i try least hit i because i know i need hour wife dogs freaking and i kid coming i like i never get sleep but anyway i love i think cool so let transition little bit talk savers exactly means what already mentioned like affirmations let six hal yeah i six i give kind outside box teaching so savers acronym sums six practices the miracle morning anybody watching listening and i want give wife credit responsible acronym savers i writing book and six practices organized and day like what wrong and i sweetie i robert kiyosaki cash flow quadrant inaudible i i ca think organize six and goes why get thesaurus see make acronym and i like you brilliant could better acronym savers i call lifesavers right and six practices virtually guaranteed save us missing full potential people miss right life look back could done much didn fulfill everything i wanted i believe six practices savers so first s i run real quick i explain so silence affirmations visualization exercise reading scribing i owe thesaurus i know hell word meant scribing i looked thesaurus so silence affirmations visualization exercise scribing s silence meditation prayer so whichever works i research meditation realize i silly meditate like i benefits profound proven people start day silence chaos right because people wait till jump bed rushing around running late versus the miracle morning allows start day peaceful purposeful silence benefits lowering stress improving clarity i physiological benefits many benefits meditating right starting day also i kind joke book much easier get start miracle morning essentially nothing you sit right nothing so s silence a affirmation hey hal hal yes please do mind i chime bug things hal oh yeah chime please yeah cool so silence meditation prayer i want step back tiny bit the reason morning quiet pretty madness pretty much correct hal exactly hal and i meant i wife i kids i dude need miracle morning like wife kids i three girls man yeah hal dude yeah need miracle i people tell i thought i i wake kids i realized i like oh gosh i better mom i better yeah hal because kids wake reacting already gone period hour scalable miracle morning people minutes customize point morning people ask could i savers later day evening whatever and i chapter book customizing miracle morning i talk want miracle afternoon miracle evening point the benefits savers profound evening day directly impacted benefits give example let take right exercise example the benefits exercise gets heart rate releases endorphins serotonin think clearer feel better energy morning energy generate like power plant generates energy extends throughout entire day if wait exercise afternoon evening missed benefits same meditation right lowers cortisol levels think clearer lower stress do want throughout day want wait till end day so six affirmations talk second but directs focus want optimize day miracle morning if want optimize sleep miracle evening whatever right so kind idea if savers end day ahead world still still experience amazing benefits yeah optimize day it kind like win morning win day that i always felt like like anything specific the miracle morning helped achieve goals i first hour mine i victorious i like winning rest day like i felt like i already succeeded day like mental shift head i depressed day reactive right like i reactive i proactive everything i i used time plan day i still today time i plan forward and anyway i love morning reason nice hal yeah i read i researching i writing the miracle morning see else i came across great article article title the morning rudder day called rudder day and like rudder ship right whichever rudder pointed determines direction ship and morning focused productive growth oriented morning type day people start day procrastination hitting snooze button right lack i discipline get bed morning let alone things you starting day stress chaos rushing right sets tone entire day i share guys favorite lines comedian demetri martin yeah i know hal do yeah great hal he hitting snooze button morning make sense it like saying i hate waking morning i anyway question nice hal that yeah answered yeah hal i answer three questions i get asked i want allow quickly jump silence i feel like i cutting it i beard i need anything else yeah lumber meditation prayer work somebody wants learn meditate find hal my favorite app meditation i tell people like book i basically two forms meditation i thousands two guided meditation listen audio typically right could watch video typically listen audio someone else guiding think focus breathe whatever then meditation right harder knew sit like i right get insecure like i supposed clear mind i thinking i stop thinking mess so favorite app called omvana that favorite meditation app meditation free app free meditation free called six phase meditation vishen lakhiani favorite minute i every day i usually like throughout day so yeah youtube search meditation get so alright starting awesome alright affirmations hal so favorite talk two reasons number i explain affirmations right good example savers addressed book action oriented practical and practices kind elusive kind mystical like meditation great example right and i think reasons book resonated people stuck i great fancy writer like i good damning things making actionable simple i think works and affirmations favorite part savers first foremost right people ask favorite saver and i i biased affirmations favorite now affirmations interesting community told miracle morning hardest time and i thought weird favorite struggle here i believe majority like perpetuated affirmations decades two ways ineffective number lie right if want millionaire i millionaire trick believing lying never optimum strategy right truth always prevail so i millionaire subconscious goes dude so first part first strategy people tried like i blank reject their subconscious rejects yeah and i i guess people think affirmations like i michael jordan stuart smalley i good enough i smart enough i people like right hal yeah another problem right i knew we dating stuart smalley yeah yeah hal the younger listeners like but yeah i good enough i smart enough dog people like so yeah problem and problem affirmations taught flowery passive language i still amazed people i respect i learned lot still teach affirmations ways the flowery language example heard variation money flows effortlessly abundance right like money works you sit back couch miracle morning work shows right you put value world you add value customers clients marketplace whatever and rewarded money so i teach like real quick synopsis rather lying saying i i using flowery language reason people like second form affirmations money flows effortlessly abundance gives temporary relief financial worries you oh money flow every day period affirmations feel better bank account balance change if i affirmations practices i want body fat show right percentage decrease bank account increase wife tell i awesome often right like i want result deal affirmations instead lying giving flowery passive promise life work right i focus affirmations book teaching make practical actionable so real simple four step kind process so i teach affirm number want like goals big goals important number want number two want what top three five reasons compelling motivating enough push challenges obstacles reminds working towards working towards the third obstacles held back past could hold back journey most people think encounter obstacles prepared stopped tracks but already thought obstacles and every day reading affirmations reminding could wrong i committed xy z wrong and final part affirmation process specifically must specifically commit ensure achieve goal so affirmations taught fantasy promise lying it i want i want could get i committed ensure i achieve goals i committed and recite read every day setting success you programming conscious subconscious behaviors alignment vision want life so operation components so awesome example i units i might i committed instead saying i want units i committed i get like i want would hal committed i like word yeah i committed units i want around kids every event i children i want job telling i soccer game and i know difficult raise money i struggled past meeting people could help get so i commit meeting people connecting real life places interacting forums time kids five years old i units hal so i would coach i would adjust instead events right i would i committed dedicating three hours day work getting closer clarifying like so important specific terms timing right like i i leaves room i later that leaves room procrastination but affirmations affirming i committed action time time days week wiggle room there oh monday and every day i remind monday i x y z rolls around programmed things yeah hey hal reciting writing every day week saying hal yeah affirmations written sure favorite parts i honest visualization next step savers v practices resonate least i know wrong brain writing i literally get design future right like i get design i affirmations always rough draft i editing affirmations time when i reading book i like oh i need i need think i need remember i need practice i literally affirmations i write word word i add so affirmations always edited also i read i dude i i four months like i need read every morning i take so yeah affirmations always rough draft form so i mine i use app phone called dayone journaling app and i use could use notes could use anything but i always affirmations so affirmations primary affirmations called my goals affirmations dated december and app always top right like top december and i affirmations i specific ones around like better husband affirmation important better father yeah sort that cool nice now i wanted talk i question later list questions asking but i think fits pretty and wrote the miracle morning whatever the miracle morning real estate agents the miracle morning salespeople correct hal and the miracle morning network marketers getting yeah right like ones so i read the miracle morning salespeople i thought would good know terms real estate investing terms i biggerpockets i thought good know so i read book and much like the miracle morning specifics sales stuff i thought great but stood like life defining moments like rich dad poor dad i read changed things work week changed things the changed things and quote book changed i thought everything it every result desire preceded process required produce result when define process commit extended period time results take care and i remember like i read i like read i read i read like times like stuff i thinking terms i six pack abs i hang picture wall six pack abs i things i want but end day process it i committed like i commit three hours day work getting units like process results take care can talk little i know i hal yeah i believe like i sales i still sales right i direct sales rep i went people homes i sold cut cook kitchen knives five years start life years old but night i bad night phone right like i called people whatever i hold three rude last hang don ever call i hate i feeling i like i nice person would talked like and night i bed like tossing turning i want get like regular job i like i deal anymore the rejection emotional ups downs i epiphany i realized i emotionally attached results results basis matter averages work commit long period time and epiphany i went i set optimize game i playing right sales game i playing i emotionally attached results which means good day sales i feel great bad day sales i feel like crap i riding roller coaster i thought i control control i control customer decides respond process many times i pick phone dial number i realized end year i sell x amount based many times i picked phone dialed number and i realized epiphany i sell double amount would simply i picked phone twice many times and epiphany i went i commit point theory kind kind like the miracle morning i i try i i set goal i i make calls next five days i see averages like many sales i make many calls and i determine many calls i need make based much i trying sell year and i thought i every day commit process making amount calls i zero emotional attachment results if i another day i calls talks i care long i made calls yeah hal because i know tomorrow next week whatever calls set eight appointments sell x amount right so theory i committed four months like experiment i every day set call goal process and i worry anything so amazing manager hated always track numbers he like sales goal week what commit selling i like i make calls day five days i let know works right so hated deal end four months first four months year i think i number sales rep company sales wow hal applying approach beauty i number sales i last place stress right like competition colleagues still riding emotional roller coaster i made calls matter i sold matter i made calls i patted back i done and result i realized applied every area life like process precedes getting shape making money selling real estate everything yeah and quickly audience real estate investors whether making calls absentee owners sales marketing apply pull emotional part use emotionless quantifiable numbers goals things like they accomplish exact i getting specific like i tell kind i think real estate i think terms funnel much like pick phone right so i tell people time i constantly telling people like many deals buy week and people like ooh i buy i like i know i many offers make many analyze i like want deals i like hypothetical numbers let analyze three deals every single every day three deals sit analyze numbers roughly month if analyze month make offers write offer great offers month what offers record offers gets accepted would it means i analyzed three deals day worked process i buy house every month i i worry ups downs oh i rejected seller work i process i analyze three deals day and i encourage people time run process make process run hal yeah exactly right exactly define process commit process without emotionally attached results end year deals instead but general right average supposed average yeah yeah things i like changed life i think real estate like i teach real estate today i write articles i life because changed everything anyway i love but move let v v savers hal oh still savers great visualization i share point visualization kind similar affirmations kind shorter point visualization typically taught gurus visualize ideal result like secret popular movie great movie lot ways but basically actionable make vision board like literally make vision board put pictures want wall sit back literally showed cartoon genie like like genie genie goes your wish i watched day making documentary studying good production stuff but like wish command like no work i lot people like hard time buying stuff like talking far everything i read book i try interviews completely blind completely stupid usually i come ahead hal that great justify reading book i know hey i hal i strategically wanted zero knowledge yeah i could live listen hal alright no i think lot people i know i alone saying oh know crap nonsense oh i genie suddenly wishes granted come give break so talking savers far i i buying i get selling you great job i love i want hear let keep hal let liking tone far love example so visualization taught genie visualize want magically happens work now two parts i teach visualization the miracle morning the i break part yes visualize end results right like see ideals coming fruition science proven establishes belief possible once see would look like came fruition wait possible i never know looks like idea bouncing around conscious surrounded fear think imagine dreams desires goals imagine every dream desire goal floating around somewhere consciousness surrounded imagine like little ball unlimited potential unlimited energy surrounded membrane dark cloudy fear insecurity and happens keeps goals dreams coming fruition visualize moments visualizing allow membrane fear open unlimited energy see would look like let free and increases belief wow possible i see i could create but second part visualization arguably important part rarely taught except athletes visualizing today ensure vision comes true so athletes visualize running marathon playing nine holes golf holes i think many anyway whatever so shows i good golfer i nine holers i attention span but point right athletes see like always i like i big fan ufc like mixed martial arts and see best fighters usually i saw fight playing every possible i saw happens i get taken i visualized i would scenario so i give real example i writing the miracle morning unlimited balls potential surrounded fear i write book buy read i know people think morning people who i overcome belief right so every day i visualized parts number i saw end result i pictured right i literally cover design like year book came i could literally see would look like and i pictured people reading i pictured telling friend you read so end result right if i would left though would done tricked feeling good like happen without effort so important part i visualized computer i would see typing i would picture expression feel emotion thoughts coming all words coming and vision end result action fired open eyes open computer type and i training marathon i saw lacing running shoes smiling i headed front door i hate running so i visualized would look like feel like i enjoyed emotionally state run so key visualization making effective opinion that sounds great when visualization i talking sitting closing eyes thinking talking making vision board look like actionably hal so vision boards fine i think cute fun anything yeah i i think bad vision board vision want end result right so see end result see family house whatever vision board i looking i rarely ever look but close eyes start question i would i today ensure i move toward vision and close eyes see importantly important feel feel like need optimum state and visualization powerful things hate best ways use right i hated running i visualized running smile i scared write i writers block visualize like athlete performing ideal today put championship trophy shelf i love kind indoctrinates big fans papasan keller keller awesome alright e exercise six pack abs let see come

helpful made note crash coming i want jump back jump you saw crash coming you mbs space where today do think made changes fed where mark looking backward i industry part reason i talking rising delinquencies point time and lot tougher markets i always bit belt suspenders type i thought know i need diversify skills little bit i young i try different things i went commercial appraising year i like learned lot went back mbs space another years crazy hot time they popping loans towards end all i work fdic closing small banks still mortgages portfolios i interesting rollercoaster sure but i definitely agree brian broadcast episodes back he talked fact time around crazy lending escalated prices i think fundamentals i think jobs come back bit i think incomes supporting mortgages people getting at time though i think financial innovation people able get access credit different ways subprime financing coming back auto home i think people consider where though i sure big real estate crash much may sexy appreciation next years feel cool thanks sharing so happened next you first deals belt working answer finance deals was cash mark yeah used family money point they cheap enough backed truck point time bought kind trying things yeah pretty easy so happened next how buy mark you know i took break long time but bought i living glenwood time i used live denver now glenwood trying start family i working commercial banker time commercial real estate loans i lot research local markets residential commercial i came across commercial building loan i liked it new loan taken another bank commercial building i felt good tenants and i left banking job went else i always remembered building sure enough day i drive i see commercial building sale the listing helped buy couple condos i also portfolio also so i went commercial building can explain liked loan what distinction liking fundamentals property mark so i guess kind i i understood loan commercial loans market like look good especially peer investment you might situation business owner may restaurant owner wants buy real estate yeah makes sense but peer investment terms buying tenant income there whole lot markets i think float so i always remembered tell us property mark so three major tenants i would tenants i tenant small top three real estate companies bigger spots i title company i state farm agent then i dentist specialty type spot and i couple i full except basement space i use office right cash flows team inherited property real estate investing much they basically wanted collect checks think hard so lot deferred maintenance problems the utilities handled the tenant relationships great just lot easy pickings work add value how would somebody know how i novice real estate investor interested commercial see property able identify deferred stuff sitting around i potentially snap cheaply make fixes drastically improve value mark and talks advantage i advantage seeing loan seeing types leases involved little bit unique situation but takes long time commercial deal by terms size million dollar deal huge deal time big yet small bigger boys you get large real estate investment group looking size building and value ad management so took gosh two three months scrutinize deal i interviewed different tenants i good handle different deferred maintenance aspects definitely intensive work still scary i end give lot information they give lease get deal done hard it painful hey mark touched upon there kind pull market this million dollar commercial deal small big boys kind scary perfect at point small big boys as somebody commercial space institutions start take notice properties is million is million is million mark i sure i best answer would surprised things i learned commercial estate story hotel experience bought hampton inn roughly knew could manage hotel better it underperforming the people bought original developers hotel get value ad billing hotel selling profit so went worked hard he lived hotel he income better culture sold year later roughly million dollar profit i would call time million dollar hotel i think two investors so i would yet scale bigger time guys so i think bigger investors look least million how finance property how able did cash financing mark no i went bank i used work i hey guys nice keep loan i helped underwriting work i showed i i gave countless spreadsheets i add value i make work and worked and conservative bank i felt good able get done that cool pretty much every webinar i biggerpockets i biggerpockets i weekly webinar usually wednesdays sign anyways almost every webinar i stressed idea help banker when trying apply loan trying get deal work banker ten loans trying process handed silver platter dig spend hours hours time digging help you front line help so i love you helped spreadsheets documents showed good deal mark oh absolutely that great tip commercial banker i tell hard most day vetting trying give bad news sorry good position and close ready help that hard part information they ballpark knowing could apply commercial loan at time though i still friends work bank it large regional bank there lot pressure market easier make want loan there good commercial real estate loans easier make want give loan sure they time resource problems sure right i i trying get loan complex i trying get loans and i went couple different banks i lot trouble getting and i flipped switch mind know i help banker job i went printed nice report i gave every bit information could possibly wanted gave information verify i put inside plastic binder i used biggerpockets rental property calculator report front showed numbers i gave within day i approved loans it like easier i realized i handing box paperwork hate so course turned busy stuff mark tell two three month vetting period i think lot folks want know exactly what evaluating give you source information right you detective work what exactly mark i would big parts specialists come so i roofing i hvac come first residential deal might hire home inspector right there value arguably but especially roof hvac i big deals i also talked city utility company worked little bit trying get idea i could add value energy savings around so i ideas i could add value energy savings so led lights big project for example buildings assessor shows era old school halogen lights awful terms energy efficiency so replacing lights led energy help covering half cost improvement i tenant halfsies half i quarter costs and everybody right that awesome that great cool do need locked contract order specialists come hey diligence period people come look mark yeah hard the owners helpful and broker listing property so although walk fine line serving parties also helpful could facilitate so answer yes without contract yes mark correct let talk financing little bit commercial financing how differ for people know commercial financing differ residential financing mark we talked lot portfolio balances i i residential portfolio loans i used small commercial bank texas i bank colorado commercial building also commercial loan some bigger differences loan talking fixed rate amortizing loans with commercial amortizing residential portfolio loan commercial building ams terms what what term mark so term talking end five years pay texas residential portfolio loan little bit different it adjusts it straight adjusts not lot exposure a lot people might wondering you five years that much time right you dollar potential loan commercial property bank says give five years that seems like lot pressure right how get around thoughts behind mark it true loans amortizing years so loan paid easier refinance point time at time i thought ben good points i know folks are talking ben leybovich mark yes no i think wrong mark he drives tesla he drive tesla that says mark that i took away podcast ben tesla you talking show i forget mark i totally imagine ben pimping around lima ohio tesla sporting i sure happy so best shows done it great show fantastic show learn ben tesla so check all right definitely adjustable makes nervous i remember sure i know i think mine balloon payment am i think anyways thinking after years years i paid significantly hopefully prices if bank could call know pay back at time hope market tank want necessarily foreclose anyways so want work hopefully worst case scenario happened but variable rate right that variable what term that i talking mark you risk i worked conservative bank inherited ton loans another bank bought kicked ton loans underwritten fit guideline anymore lot folks hustle mark bank town sometimes worked sometimes there lot hard stories commercial market sure this i like i loan like i ones ten years whatever i want make sure i enough equity i significantly like i want risky loans speak i want option later able get and commercial loans typically lend loan value they usually mark from bank perspective want long talking loan lot pucker interest rate risk they want deal at time investor keeps disciplined mark house five years sort theory people talk keep things time parse portfolio five years start hey mark standard payment commercial loan mark usually i see and tips somebody looking purchase commercial property minimize risk how mark i would homework key best market lot fewer competition for example i far youngest commercial real estate investor town everybody else i around talking different people tenants buildings i ask hey landlord they llc california i never met and long rented oh years you never met landlord years it faceless or investor building years getting older want put money pretty easy hustle best landlord small market lot success mark old mark i turn june oh i beat february you old mark look hair you gray hair compared i silverback grilling sure looking good man that good hard want hustle it hard people might envision getting commercial real estate i want basic why get commercial real estate what point what benefits niche mark comes commercial real estate valued based income property value ad cut expenses plenty deals better manage expense at time though able hustle creative for example might lot guests talk buy commercial building you need office there could lot benefits right you may friends need office space downstairs basement completely unutilized all sudden due social media different apps whatever might make basement building example i could totally i think ten years ago ballgame i like commercial reason ability add value creative using head add cash pocket end day equity later road that awesome do manage properties commercial ones mark i manage everything colorado exception denver property the stuff i texas i manager but yeah everything glenwood i manage we talked nth degree managing houses stuff like talked managing commercial so like what different mark hmm that good question i would different things you stone removal bigger issue you landscaping you outdoor trash things deal much residential the leases much complicated cheap you use attorneys possible i think also culture big deal building if could good culture everybody gets along good synergies tenant businesses that goes long adding value we signed working space little signed commercial lease we square foot office space and oh man signing five think current lease pages like mark you triple net inaudible it exceptionally complicated there sorts gotchas things like i looked leases past old school tenants i would need literally get permission put wifi office space but typewriter written lease like so yeah i think advice using real estate attorney spot listen i think spot anybody particularly commercial kind paperwork assume know hell tenant landlord remarkable it interesting culture part i think i bet lot big corporate landlords think somebody shopping we looked lot buildings you surgeon office next random combinations like never interact there never positivity vibe within building i think trying least establish kind culture i think like anything else get leases get people could stick around want little extra keep moving somewhere else mark a couple tenants building since so lot value good landlord hustle everybody gets along sure why leave it hassle leave so make landlord differently big corporate faceless nameless entities what gives commercial attract tenants much big guys mark first somebody calls i reply within least two hours second i usually meet primary year i different maintenance things i different improvements i let know neighbors i tenant hey met everybody and around shake hands get everybody comfortable in fact year i gave everybody jimmy john lunch good tenants holidays little stuff like very cool awesome before get i want touch base little bit besides commercial vacation rentals else besides you right mark yeah i portfolio texas i whole lot it lot homes then commercial building talked and i four vacation rentals i vrbo airbnb kind strategy i four furnished condos i month longer nice synergy vacation rentals i might somebody i move vacation rental shoulder slow season i getting lot travelling nurses temporary workers sometimes folks need stay three months sometimes six months or i may retired couple wants ski season they want spend couple thousand bucks month vacation rental furnished condo yeah works great that cool and manage right mark yeah i lot help i couple cleaning people couple maintenance people i sort facetime that cool and anticipate vacation rentals headed mark i would like may direction peer technology play marketing vacation rentals help provide structure business i personally want use time grow aspect next step find lot value ad understanding executing bigger deals but medium larger deals million five million bucks i look investors execute opportunities cool mark far commercial vacation vacation i pretty unique mix seems like crafted intentionally is case did intentionally mark part best opportunity time a lot vacation rentals resort market time i bought best things terms value buy terms price point what could worst case scenario lease i could route it give best yield good scenario so i at time though little big labor intensive especially vacation rental side execute it passive business lucrative yeah quickly brought talked furnished versus vacation versus standard lease what goes how different seems like quasi two what different running furnished property super apartment vacation rental typical lease mark obviously cleaning bigger part standard so kind come little bit program two cleaning folks maintenance people time turnover execute we know day i planning couple weeks advance always at time keeping booked i lot success i would sort intermediate term rentals i couple months past four years i things filled so means though i might travelling nurse working area six months called i told tight market i accommodate first two months i move next and know they lot choice i best products so synergies sort work different units i love diversification within asset class and i also love wrote blog post couple weeks ago topic finding strategy look good what abilities what location like it kind like intersection lot different things i love figured works area i advise people time listen many podcasts start hear things today dozens people man mark strategy exactly i want that works i gray area and people like someday i keep file cabinet i come back so i love very cool and reminder set path anybody particularly i think important reiterate newbies despite educators might tell single path there single strategy work i tell unless pay hold let bust wallet right let call credit card company extend limit so every niche working within market what works he looking niches strategies kind polishing formulating plan works plan create strategy upfront start take steps forward start making

sharad oh so let talk rental first property bought anyway i know rental let talk first property bought come happened sharad the first investment property sure let first investment property sharad the first investment property i bought two unit was sharad a two unit duplex indiana i lived chicago i live california i lived chicago back and i interested investing rental properties my wife i saved money i reading lot real estate and around guys pay i came across no jokes i seriously came across if anybody goes profile back beginning i became member and i bought first property august nice sharad and i paid cash fixed bought second september like four weeks later it three unit the first i paid i spent and i rented units i getting month rent combined wow sharad so pretty good deal tenants paying utilities and i i honest i learned things i never taken real estate course book i read the journey real estate investors so kind gave idea i wanted i get excited flips i i flips back i see buying property selling fixing selling it appeal much buying fixing renting i wanted passive income can i talk cheaper prices talking lot lately i couple weeks ago show ben leybovich brian burke serge shukhat talked dangers buying property low income area like area not look inexpensive houses yeah inexpensive houses like usually always found areas but i video bonus videos came book rental property investing launched videos i called the truth about buying houses so lot conversation and went bought living can kind tell i like great cash flowing properties today are value i tell us early properties like today five years later yeah yeah five years later still recommend still buy sharad yeah i still buy inexpensive properties i moved little bit better area sharad yeah i i moved within county different city areas i invested small county made cities so i primarily focus three main cities so first city i bought properties i would call c area for example first property i bough i paid i think i spent so i i six months year later i refinance place i money the second property i bought i paid three year let needed i put i think i getting month rent and upgraded six months i able get majority money today still cash flowing i still properties i still happy make money everywhere i enough properties every properties give issue volume particular neighborhood per se i neighborhoods per se better but take risk lower income area know risk higher getting higher cash flow but long ready i walk park ups downs would i back absolutely without doubt cool i like hearing perspective i always warning people careful properties dangerous like buy property i ton cash flow right so imagine bought property put rent month those numbers i hear often end day cash flow yours rented month like solid numbers sharad right i tell i research area i would drive areas i literally would call local police department i would talk sergeant i would i looking buy property guys think i would literally ask if son daughter buying property investment would recommend i would buy yes wow great tip yeah interesting sharad that i i i idea ask somebody i calling police department i anymore i first started i ask crime stats but i would ask i first started asking person i talking i would ask hey would recommend son daughter somebody family invest property and think start looking different perspective and i think helped would tell yeah price right interesting sharad so i needed know price right area fine working good far that cool awesome that cool hey quick talked c area people know a b c quickly sharad i a b easiest define a would like i would example i lived down town chicago i moved i live carlsberg california i would call i living down town chicago a area where i live carlsberg california a area school districts good in case average starting home prices so high income areas i would call a area everybody wants live essentially d would nobody wants live live place live they make enough money live area there lot gang activity would d area to b c would fall somewhere a b would would i live area i if answer yes b area if i live would i concerned safety if answer yeah b area my property manager female would i comfortable dark collect rent or i send wife dark collect rent would i feel comfortable if answer yes b area not first choice area live i would i average school rating four five c would somewhere b d i guess fair enough cool so talked lived chicago sharad yes and properties bought indiana sharad yes minutes outside downtown chicago i guess i familiar area much they close yeah yeah i thinking like hours hours away far sharad no best think area i invested lake county indiana best think area suburb chicago like local news get part indiana chicago news like news get chicago covers part indiana connects i like difference house town thanks alright yeah i sharad i still office indiana i slide back least month i fly chicago airport either o hare midway i indiana sometimes i stay sometimes i stay brother chicago i commute every day so find location i determine area wanted invest sharad i guess kind research i came handy i wanted within minutes hour drive downtown chicago sharad i could east i would lake michigan you could i might real estate somewhere sharad i could yeah west would west would expensive south safe enough so i looked south east indiana kind i started looking and i like hey let see available at first i realize close indiana chicago and i would call agents i would like hey guys time zone or guys hour ahead because indianapolis i assumed whole state indiana i started looking i would work weekends drive around talk people just make familiar area i started that cool so talk calling agents talking people what people talking sharad i would literally local grocery store talk people call convenient store gas station call police department ask neighborhood just talk local people i would drive around neighborhood i wanted feel comfortable and i see lot graffiti houses lot boarded houses i kind stayed away area agent part i strategy learning area strategy finding deals deals sharad initially i first started everything i bought mls deals i back nobody cash i buying cash lending gave little bit leg people i could take the first house i bought listed i bought wow sharad i started cash offer week closing they came back i initially came guys paying anyway wait quick property listed ball offer why offer sharad because i thought worth sharad i cash i i first started i would buy everything directly listing agent i agent i would call listing agents tip i found get inside information selling agent would little bit extra motivation get deal done houses making lot money if dollar commission split another person making get little bit information real motivation important number and i hey let start let see come back they came back i went back they came i take leave took that great i like tip lot masterful yeah love tip saying work selling agent instead agent they get extra money now i technically legally supposed added motivation incentive they supposed present everything equally fairly represent seller but come know i like double income so course little quicker import they stack offers put first bank know ask opinion anyway definitely work harder using i think great tip you obviously agent necessarily side like fiduciary word like fiduciary yeah technically representing careful good tip get good deals sharad i another i started first i time hand i cash available so i wanted use time much get highest rate return time much possible so i enough time deal listing it create little bit extra work i deal listing agents often every i know good deal i call listing agent hey i need get deal tell number put offer but create little bit extra work part worse working buyer agent i much anymore i first started hey sharad walk conversation get phone call listing agent property listed think worth how probe agent get information or least find bottom line seller sharad let house listed i think real worth i would i put offer think is i ballpark i no let take see seller comes back least i know i somewhere ballpark if i seller yielding anything don worry wasting so kind get idea ballpark put offer see seller comes back and kind selling agent come back if come couple thousand dollars whatever i make happen seller and kind get idea within i love tip i think particularly newer investors i think outstanding strategy i particularly knowledge point know numbers exact ballpark you still learning still trying figure offers person able kind flex knowledge spoken seller helpful sharad right i buyer agent bring listing i know hard deal i call agent hey call listing agent offer bonus i pay directly just try get idea need and sometimes works sometimes interesting i done i agent i work lot i call listing agent every time i want i hurting relationship buyer agent represented lot so i lot times i agent call agent i like hey jason call agent feel offer see and knows game call buddy buddies small town agents know and get back bee like yeah i think pretty so yeah good get around agent sharad right i agree i keeping relationship agent definitely agent i think i deals within every year get commission deal understands if flip deal get backend rental property know kill get deal awesome many deals done year lot sharad and composition versus flips sharad i would i hold portfolio free clear loan nothing sharad and big majority wholesale deals sharad wholesale overseas company interesting sharad
